          Kibana has the ability to alert based on events discovered in Elastic indexes.
          Alerts can be enabled through defined rules, which detect complex conditions with Kibana and trigger actions when those conditions are met.  
          It can be centrally managed from the Stack Management.

          Authservice allows the use of an external identity OIDC provider for application login
          by configuring filter chain matching for hostname (headers) for applications.  
          This control can then be inherited by the Identity Provider.

          You can log security-related events such as authentication failures and refused connections to monitor your cluster for suspicious activity (including data access authorization and user security configuration changes).
          Use the Kibana audit logs in conjunction with Elasticsearch audit logging to get a holistic view of all security related events. 
          Kibana defers to the Elasticsearch security model for authentication, data index authorization, and features that are driven by cluster-wide privileges.

          TLS requires X.509 certificates to authenticate the communicating parties and perform encryption of data-in-transit.

          The solution covers four areas of monitoring: Uptime, APM, Metrics, and Logs. Uptime monitors availability by sending external heartbeats to the service endpoints. 
          APM monitors latency and quality by measuring and capturing events directly from within the applications. Metrics monitors saturation by measuring infrastructure resource utilization. 
          Logs monitors correctness by capturing messages from systems and services.
